Snake Game README

Overview

A classic implementation of the Snake game in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a snake that can move around the screen, eat food pellets, and grow in length. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundary or itself.

Features

- Snake movement and control using arrow keys
- Food pellets that spawn randomly on the screen
- Score tracking and display
- Game over screen with final score display
- Smooth animation and graphics

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (pip install pygame)

Usage

1. Install the Pygame library using pip: pip install pygame
2. Run the game script using Python: python snake_game.py
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and eat food pellets.
4. Try to avoid colliding with the boundary or yourself.

Gameplay

- Eat food pellets to grow the snake's length and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the boundary or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the boundary or itself.

Troubleshooting

- If the game crashes or freezes, check the console output for error messages.
- Make sure you have the latest version of Pygame installed.

Future Development

- Add sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Implement different game modes, such as speed modes or obstacle modes.
- Enhance graphics and animation for a more polished look.
